          <h2>Who is Eric?</h2>
          <p>
            Ever since I was a young child, I knew I needed to be in the IT field 
            one way or another. My foot in the door moment was my best friends shop 
            where he built custom computers and installed car neon lights in the cases 
            before RGB. From there I went to school and majored in CS and dabbled in 
            my share engineering. I left to work my way through some amazing companies 
            as a Network/System Engineer. There was always a side of me that was not 
            happy though. I needed more, I wanted to learn it all. It started by using 
            PowerShell to automate simple tasks that were too mundane. I moved on to 
            Linux enviroments and Bash. But it just did not have what I wanted. It had 
            its limitations. So that is when I moved to Python and JavaScript. I was 
            able to do so much with Pyhton, and make my websites amazing with JavaScript.

          <h2>Be a Developer</h2>
          <p>
            I have seven rules to be a developer that I live by:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Automate everything.   
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Document everything. 
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Try to cut cost somewhere, anywhere. 
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Read the documentation/manual.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Save all emails.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. Research as much as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. Love your job.
